# Work_Day_Scheduler

Using Jquery, css and HTML 5 I have made a Work Day Schedule which shows current day and time in the header using moment.js. User can write their plans in the text area and when the save button is clicked it will locally store and display items. When the clear button is clicked, all stored items will be cleared from local storage and the page when it reloads. <br>
